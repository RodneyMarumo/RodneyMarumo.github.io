                    <span class="p1 top-2">Caroline and I were formally introduced by a mutual friend when we were both students
					at the University of Botswana. At the time, we were both doing a Bachelor of Science hoping to transfer 
					abroad to do our respective courses It had been almost a year after relocating to Melbourne, Australia, 
					when I found out that one of the first year students that would be coming to study in Melbourne the following 
					year was Caroline.. My memory of her was surprisingly fresh in my mind. Sure enough, Caroline landed in Melbourne 
					in February 2010, and we were both very happy to see each other. We talked like we had known each other for 10 years. 
					Within a week, I had convinced her to join Facebook and we started chatting and spending a lot of time together.
					
					Life at University soon became very interesting as I looked forward to the long walks we would take together after Uni. At times, 
					we would go to the library together to study. By March 2010, I knew that this was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my 
					life with. We started dating on the 13th of March 2010, shortly after my 21st birthday.

                                <span class="text-5 top-5">I am the oldest of three boys in my family. I was born in Francistown,
								a city in the North Eastern part of Botswana and I have since travelled and lived in different parts of the country until finally settling in Gaborone where I received most of my education. 
								Upon completion of High School in St. Joseph's College, I went to University of Botswana (UB) where I did a Bachelor of Science. 
								It was at UB that I first met Caroline, and decided that I wanted to become a Doctor. After 3 semesters in UB, I relocated to Melbourne, 
								Australia, where my life changed forever. Besides getting a medical degree, I fell in love with my favourite girl in the world.
								I hope to one day become an interventional Cardiologist. Besides Medicine, I play tennis,
								chess and I love spending time outdoors. </span>
